Just recently the programming language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) took my
interest, especially in combination its ability to write fast and typesafe
low-level code. Moreover it can compile to webassembly - so I thought why not
give it a try.

This is the result:

 - demo [here](./app.html)
 - initial verison [of the code](./src/lib.rs) and [cargo file](./Cargo.toml)
   which is derived from [rustwasm.github.io](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/introduction.html)
 - if you want to study it more closely, just clone the repo from [github](https://github.com/epsilonhalbe/wasm_game_of_life)
   the branch "hex-of-life"

I hope you find it useful.
