This was a little side project of mine, it started out when I was trying out
some Scrum Mastering at my company for two teams - we regularly were over-time
in our daily stand-ups - so I looked for a scrum clock that could do multiple
teams, variable time (the smaller team was just 3 members, but unless time was
on we were talking too long.) and some ability to save the team members.

This is my first attempt of using Elm for something meaningful.

 - [the clock](./app.html) free to use (the team is saved in your browser's
   local storage)
 - [the code](./src/Main.elm) and [elm-package](./elm-package.json) the code is
   licensed under a BSD3 License.

I hope you find it useful.
