title: About me
---

I am Martin Heuschober born 1984 in Linz (Austria), went to Vienna in 2003 to
study Mathematics. During my studies I learnt a lot, including LaTeX, Mathematica,
some Java and a bit of Python. In 2009 I stumbled upon the wikipedia article on
Haskell, the programming language I now love. In order to lean more about
functional programming I, became a member of the
"[Lambdaheads](https://metalab.at/wiki/Lambdaheads)", a group of people
interested in functional programming, which I now have the honour of organizing.

I finished my studies in April 2013, with a thesis in the section of differential
geometry, probability theory, data analysis and algebraic topology with the help
of my supervisor Dr. Stefan Haller. In September 2014 I moved to Marseille for
two months, which I will never forget. After a this experience I came back to
Austria looking for a flat and a job - which I found.

I have worked as a 2nd level support for [terna](http://www.terna.com) which
included some programming in Javex (a bastard child of [Java][1] and [RPG 400][2]),
Java, C#, JScript and SQL. I also had the pleasure of mentoring two new
colleagues.

Now I work at [T-Systems Austria][4] as a full time [Haskell][3] developer and
learning some JavaScript as well.

In my spare time I enjoy meeting friends, occasionally play boardgames, learn
more about programming, practise [Feldenkrais][5] when the time allows it, cook and
hopefully write a blog ;-).
